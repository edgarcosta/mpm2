I completed undergraduate studies and an M.Sc. and my M.Sc. at Moscow State University (MSU)
I also finished my PhD thesis at MSU in 1988, under the supervision of Yuri Kubyshin, Igor Volobuev 
and Dmitrii V. Shirkov. I am interested in different aspects of the interaction between Quantum Field Theory 
and Modern Geometry. I am a full professor at the Mathematics Department at IST, Lisbon, since 2013.
