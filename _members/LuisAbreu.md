Luís Daniel Abreu did his PhD and early research work in Classical Analysis, at the University of Coimbra, where he benefited from contact with students like Joel Moreira, Afonso Bandeira and João Pereira, the latter two becoming his collaborators. After a post-doc at NuHAG, led by Hans Feichtinger, he was a Senior Researcher at the Acoustics Research Institute (Austrian Academy of Sciences), and developed a passionate interest in the mathematical structures behind signal analysis. Currently, he works in time-frequency analysis, a field at the crossroads of pure and applied mathematics, with manifold connections to representation theory, wavelets, function spaces, operator algebras, number theory, operator-related function theory, spectral geometry, noncommutative geometry, packing problems, statistics and probability, quantum information theory and hyperuniformity. Exploring the connections among these topics and their applications in acoustic data analysis defines his core research activity.
