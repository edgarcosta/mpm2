Edgar Costa received his Ph.D. in 2015 from the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University and was a Postdoctoral Fellow at ICERM during the semester program “Computational Aspects of the Langlands Program”.
Prior to joining the collaboration, he was an Instructor in Applied and Computational Mathematics at Dartmouth College.
Costa’s research interests are centered around effective methods in arithmetic geometry, arithmetic statistics, and number theory.
His current research is focused on the development and application of theoretical and computational techniques to study the interconnections predicted by the Langland’s program.
