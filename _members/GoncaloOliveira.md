Since November 2021 I have been a NOMIS Fellow at IST Austria working in the Hausel group. Previously, I had positions as an Assistant Professor at Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF) (2018-2021), a postdoc in IMPA (2017-2018) and as an Elliot Assistant Research Professor at Duke University (2014-2017). I also had a visiting scientist position at the Max Planck Institute in Bonn (Germany), which I visited for the summer of 2015. <br>
I completed my PhD in 2014 at Imperial College London, under the supervision of Sir Simon Donaldson.
