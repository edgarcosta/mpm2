I am a Chargé de Recherche (CNRS researcher) at the University of Toulouse (IMT) since 2022. 
I'm mostly interested in operads, graph complexes, homotopical algebra and the way they interact 
with physics and algebraic topology.
I completed my PhD under the supervision of Thomas Willwacher and was an SNF Postdoc at the University Paris 13 
hosted by Bruno Vallette and became a chargé de recherche in Montpellier (IMAG) in 2018.
