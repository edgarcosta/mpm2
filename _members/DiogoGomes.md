Diogo Gomesâ€™s research interests are in partial differential equations (PDE), 
namely on viscosity solutions of elliptic, parabolic and Hamilton-Jacobi equations as well as in related mean-field models. 
This area includes a large class of PDEs and examples, ranging from classical linear equations to highly nonlinear PDEs, 
including the Monge-Ampere equation, geometric equations for image processing, 
non-linear elasticity equations and the porous media equation. 
His research is motivated directly or indirectly by concrete applications.
